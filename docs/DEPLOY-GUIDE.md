cd qavibeapp
npm install
npm install -g pm2

# Start with PM2 (keeps running)
pm2 start blog-server-db.js --name "qavibe-blog"
pm2 startup
pm2 save

# Setup reverse proxy (Nginx)
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**Benefits**:
- Full server control
- SQLite works perfectly
- Easy backups: just copy `blog.db`
- $5-20/month

## 📊 **SQLite vs PostgreSQL Decision**

### **✅ STICK WITH SQLITE FOR YOUR BLOG BECAUSE:**

- **Your Use Case**: Personal/company blog
- **Traffic**: Likely < 1000 concurrent users
- **Data**: Blog posts (not complex relations)
- **Simplicity**: One file, easy backups
- **Cost**: No separate database hosting fees
- **Performance**: SQLite is FAST for read-heavy workloads (blogs)

### **SQLite Can Handle:**
- ✅ **Millions of blog posts**
- ✅ **Thousands of concurrent readers**
- ✅ **Full-text search**
- ✅ **Complex queries**
- ✅ **Transactions**

### **Only upgrade to PostgreSQL if:**
- ❌ You need > 1000 concurrent writers
- ❌ You want advanced analytics
- ❌ You have multiple databases to sync
- ❌ You need distributed setup
